## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep purple (#4B0082) to evoke luxury and gambling themes.
- Background color: Black (#000000) to create a high-contrast and modern look.
- Accent color: Neon blue (#13EAC9) for highlights and interactive elements, drawing attention to key actions and creating a futuristic aesthetic.
- Font: 'Space Grotesk', a modern sans-serif, to give titles and headings a computerized, techy feel.
- Use glowing icons for different game modes: a sword clash for Battles, a rocket for Crash, and floating orbs for Plinko.
- Maintain a responsive layout with a collapse-able sidebar on mobile; use a bottom navigation bar for the main tabs on smaller screens.
- Implement hover effects on interactive items; create button transitions (smooth scaling or light pulses) and ensure the mystery box opening has visually exciting glow and explosion animations.
